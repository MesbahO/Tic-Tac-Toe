# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using modern functional react hooks and styled with SCSS.

The app is fully responsive and useable in all device sizes.

The game begins once two players have set their preferred colours. 

The next step is to clean up the design and flesh out additonal features such as keeping track of scoring.
